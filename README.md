# Traffic Collision Analysis

## Introduction
In this project, we delve into various dimensions of traffic collisions to unearth underlying patterns and causes. Our comprehensive analyses aim to bolster understanding and aid in the development of strategies to enhance road safety.

### Collision Analysis
We conducted a detailed investigation into the primary causes of road collisions and the resulting fatalities. This analysis provides crucial insights into the most prevalent factors contributing to traffic incidents, guiding preventive measures and policy-making.

### Time Series Analysis
Our time series analysis focuses on identifying peak times for traffic collisions. By analyzing the frequency of incidents across different times of day and days of the week, we can pinpoint high-risk periods. This information is essential for optimizing traffic management and safety interventions.

### Fatality Analysis
This segment explores the circumstances leading up to collisions and the subsequent fatalities. Understanding these pre-crash scenarios is vital for emergency response planning, improving road design, and enhancing driver awareness and training programs.

## Data Source
The data utilized for our analyses is sourced from the following public dataset provided by the City of New York. This dataset includes detailed records of motor vehicle collisions, offering a robust foundation for our study.
